  ## Description
  This is a simple quiz showcasing the capabilities of javascript and how it can be used to manipulate the DOM. On click of the start button, a timer will start and you will be given 100 seconds to complete this quiz. If you get a question wrong, time will be deducted from the timer. If you get every question wrong, the timer will stop, but you will have to go through the questions again until you get at least one correct. After you complete the quiz, you will have the opportunity to store your high score on the high score page. This utilizes local storage to allow the data to persist through a browser refresh.
