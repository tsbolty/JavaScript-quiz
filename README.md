I created a welcome page with a button to start he quiz

on start of that button, it sets the display of that div to none and sets the first question page to block

I know it could have been done more dynamically, but that's what I did to rotate between each question page.

after the quiz is started, it shows your score at the top of the page and starts a 60 second timer in the right corner.

upon click of a choice option, it will allert the user if the answer was correct or incorrect and add 1 to the score if the answer was correct. If the answer was not correct, it will deduct 10 seconds from the timer

this goes on for 5 questions.

If the time runs out, it will discard any text on the screen and display an image.

if you successfully complete the page, you will be taken to a page where you can input your initials in the input box, and your initials and your score will be displayed in the high score area.

If you score 0 answers correct, the timer will pause and you will be looped through the quiz again. the quiz will not end until you get at least one questoin correct.
